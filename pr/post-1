**“Mom, You’re Fired.”**
*A Children’s Story for Grown-Ups Who Never Gave Up*

We should write a children’s book about my life — but told from when I was a kid. You buy me my first computers, I’m taking them apart, breaking them, fixing them, playing games, learning without even realizing it.

Then the story fast-forwards — the boy grows up, builds something great, and says to his mom with a smile:
**“Mom, you’re fired.”**

Not because he’s mad — but because she never has to work another day again.
They’ve made it. Together.

It’s a full-circle story about love, grit, and faith — with two Black faces on the cover: a mother and son who defy the odds and live happily ever after. It’s joyful, emotional, and powerful enough to move both church congregations and classrooms.

There’s a massive audience waiting — especially in Christian and academic spaces — for a story that reminds us that belief, persistence, and family can rewrite any ending.
