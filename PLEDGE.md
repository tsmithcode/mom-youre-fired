# 10% Youth STEM + Sports Pledge

**Author:** Thomas Devon Smith II  
**Project:** Mom, You’re Fired  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-30

I pledge **10% of net proceeds** from sales of this digital/print product to **STEM and sports programs serving inner-city youth**, with priority to:

1. **Baltimore, Maryland** – origin city.
2. **Atlanta, Georgia** – current community (Atlanta Tech Village, local churches, youth sports).

**Why:**  
> “In investing, as in life, behavior beats brilliance every time.”  
This project exists to reward the behavior of parents who invest early in their kids.

**Reporting:**  
A simple giving report will be published in this repository at least once per year as `giving-REPORT-YYYY.md`.
