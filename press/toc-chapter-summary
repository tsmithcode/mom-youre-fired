## **Chapter Summaries**

### **1. The Little Engineer**

In a Baltimore rowhouse, young Thomas spends hours staring at glowing screens, fascinated by what makes computers work. His imagination outpaces his resources, but his curiosity becomes his compass.

---

### **2. Mom’s Miracle Purchase**

His mother, Louise Regina Pender Smith, stretches every dollar to surprise her son with his first used computer. It’s not new, but it’s magic. That moment — a single act of faith and sacrifice — changes both their lives forever.

---

### **3. Screws, Wires, and Wonder**

Thomas takes the computer apart, piece by piece, despite his mother’s panic. But when he puts it back together and it works, she realizes: he’s not breaking things — he’s learning how they work.

---

### **4. Learning to Fix What’s Broken**

The story expands beyond machines. Through setbacks, bullies, and tough lessons, Thomas learns that fixing broken things — whether it’s hardware, hope, or heart — takes patience and love.

---

### **5. The Power of Encouragement**

Louise becomes his biggest cheerleader, telling him he can build anything. Their bond deepens as she works long hours and he dreams even longer ones. Faith becomes their shared language.

---

### **6. Dreams Bigger Than Baltimore**

Graduating from Watkins Mill High School in Gaithersburg, Thomas sets his sights beyond Maryland. He knows there’s more out there — and that his purpose will be built, not handed to him.

---

### **7. New Beginnings in Texas**

Moving to Dallas to live with his father and brother, Thomas discovers how far courage can take him. The city challenges him, but also opens doors he never knew existed.

---

### **8. The Dentist’s Workshop**

Working in a dental R&D lab in Grand Prairie, Texas, he uses his CAD skills to design surgical tools for tooth extractions. The boy who once took computers apart is now designing tools that help people heal.

---

### **9. The Factory and the Fire Inside**

From manufacturing lines to design labs, Thomas builds a career that fuses creativity and technology. Each job — from Fry Reglet to Daikin Applied — becomes another step toward entrepreneurship.

---

### **10. Atlanta Awakening**

Thomas moves to Atlanta, the city of innovation and culture. Immersed in the Atlanta Tech community, he finds not just opportunity, but purpose: to build, teach, and uplift.

---

### **11. Faith, Family, and the Future**

Thomas credits every victory to his mother’s unwavering faith. Together, they reflect on how God turned hardship into harmony — how every test became testimony.

---

### **12. “Mom… You’re Fired.”**

In the emotional finale, Thomas smiles and tells his mom, “You’re fired.” Not because she did anything wrong — but because she’s finally free. Their story comes full circle: the mother who worked to give her son a future now gets to rest in the one she helped him create.
