**Overview**
*Mom, You’re Fired* is a heart-warming, inspirational children’s book for all ages — a story of perseverance, faith, and love between a mother and son who turn struggle into success. It follows a curious young boy who takes apart his first computers and learns to rebuild them, guided by a mother who believes in him long before the world does. Years later, as an accomplished entrepreneur, he tells her, “Mom, you’re fired” — not out of anger, but triumph. She never has to work again.
