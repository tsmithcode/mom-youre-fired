## What this is

**_Mom, You’re Fired_** is a children’s / family book about a Black mother who buys her son his first computer, he takes it apart, grows into an engineer–entrepreneur, and one day tells her:

> **“Mom… you’re fired.”**  
> (because she never has to work again)

This repo is the public, transparent build of the book. All source content is in **Markdown + PNG** so it can be:
- sold as digital via Stripe
- printed on demand
- reviewed by churches, schools, and tech communities
- shown at **Atlanta Tech Village** and, God willing, stages way bigger than that
