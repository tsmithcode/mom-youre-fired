### Notes for the Illustrator

* **Characters must stay consistent:**

  * Mom = Louise Regina Pender Smith, medium-brown skin, 80s/90s Baltimore energy → later, mature, elegant.
  * Thomas = lighter/darker version of your actual kid pic — use your kids’ photo as the base.
* **Art style:** same as your provided cover — rounded, clean, Black family forward, aspirational.
* **Aspect ratio:** 12 landscape spreads (8.5x11 or 10x8) so you can print or show on iPad.
* **Keep computers & tools era-appropriate:** old CRT in Baltimore, more modern CAD screen in Texas, laptop in Atlanta.
* **Core theme to keep visible:** **“Behavior beats brilliance.”** Sneak it onto a sticky note, bookshelf, or wall art in 2–3 frames.

If you hand this to an illustrator, they can paint straight from it. If you use DALL·E, just feed each frame description as a separate prompt.
