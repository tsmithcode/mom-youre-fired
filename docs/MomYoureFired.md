# Mom, You’re Fired.

_By Thomas Devon Smith II_

> “In investing, as in life, behavior beats brilliance every time.”

This is a story about a mom from Baltimore who bought her son a computer she couldn’t really afford… and it turned into a life she always prayed for.

## 1. The Little Engineer
Thomas was born in **Baltimore, Maryland in 1990**. His mom, **Louise Regina Pender Smith** (born August 1966, also in Baltimore), was the kind of mom who noticed what her son stared at. He stared at screens.

## 2. Mom’s Gift
One day she brought home a used computer. Not brand new. Not fancy. But to a kid, it was everything.

...

## 12. “Mom… You’re Fired.”
When Thomas was grown, working in Atlanta, part of the tech community, he called his mom and said:

> “Mom… you’re fired.”  
> “From working. From worrying. From starting over.  
> You invested in me. I got the return.”

They both laughed. Then they both cried.

**The End.**
